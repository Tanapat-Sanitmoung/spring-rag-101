LLM stands for Large Language Model, a type of artificial intelligence designed to process and generate human-like language. It is trained on vast amounts of text data and can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering.

A Large Language Model uses deep learning techniques to learn patterns in language and generate coherent responses. The output is often written in a specific format, making it suitable for various applications.

To write about LLM and save it to a file, we can use the following code:
